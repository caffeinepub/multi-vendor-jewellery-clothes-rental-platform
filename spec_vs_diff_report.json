  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the 13 requirements for the premium home page redesign. Most sections (Hero, Trust Strip, Categories, How It Works, Trending Products, Nearest Centers, Vendor CTA, Testimonials, Footer, Header, conversion elements, SEO) are implemented. A few specific acceptance criteria gaps are identified, particularly around the Footer column naming, and the JSON-LD schema type not matching the requested product listing schema.",

      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Footer must have five named link columns: About Us, Platform links, For Business, Legal, and Contact Us. The Platform column must list Jewellery, Bridal Sets, Party Wear, Designer Dresses.",
      "reason": "The Footer diff shows FOOTER_LINKS with keys labeled 'Collections' (not 'Platform'), 'For Business', and 'Legal', plus an unnamed brand column. There is no explicit 'About Us' column title. The Platform column is named 'Collections' and includes an extra 'Trending Products' link not in the spec. The five distinct named columns as specified are not clearly present.",
